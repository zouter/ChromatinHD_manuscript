#  Predictive sequence models

This was a test to predict gene expression from the sequence around a fragment. The goal here is to learn what sequences have to be open for gene expression to occur.
Some initial prototypes indicated that this does work, but the overall approach was abandoned for the original manuscript because it requires much more work and certainly deserves its own dedicated manuscript.
