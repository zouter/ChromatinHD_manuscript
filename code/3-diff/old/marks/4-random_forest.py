# # Random forest regression
#
#
# This notebook is dedicated to exploring how a random forest regression model is able to predict the absolute value/fold change of the signal for each of the histone marks analysed. The model is trained on the features that were used to define the different types of topologies.

# Plotted above are the r2 values of the random forest regression models; the feature importances of the models; and the shap plots for the models with r2 values > 0.03, which provide information about the direction of the features on the model output. 
#
# If we consider the models with a significant r2 value (H3K27ac, H3K4me1 and H3K4me3), we can observe that although most features are used for the model prediction, some features seem to be more prominent. For example, we see that the max value of a slice is very important in the prediction of the signal value of H3K27ac. This histone is commonly found near gene promoters and enhancer regions, and it plays a crucial role in regulating transcriptional activation. Higher values of differential DNA accessibility are often associated with the presence of H3K27ac, indicating active enhancer regions and active gene expression (https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14590, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5042844/).
#
# Another noteworthy feature is the prominence, which measures how isolated the differential peak is compared to other peaks. This feature seems to have a positive correlation for H3K4me1, and a negative correlation for H3K4me3. This could be explained by the fact that H3K4me1 is associated with enhancer regions and is involved in regulating tissue-specific gene expression and enhancer activity, generally being found at active and poised enhancers. On the other hand, H3K4me3 is involved in promoting an open chromatin structure and facilitating transcriptional initiation. Therefore, it is predominantly associated with gene activation and is enriched near the transcription start sites of actively transcribed genes

# Here we have another set of random forest regression models for the prediction of the fold change values instead of the absolute values. Once again, we see that the r2 values seem to be significant only for H3K27ac, H3K4me1 and H3K4me3. However, as we could expect, we find that different features seem to be more important for the prediction of the fold change. Namely, we observe that the average_lfc and the balances_raw play a big role in the determination of the output.
